# FFmpeg Build Scripts 

This repository is a collection of build scripts to build FFmpeg/libav libraries for various native platforms. It is based off the now deprecated [FFmpegKit](https://github.com/arthenica/ffmpeg-kit) repository.

### Scripts

Use `android.sh`, `ios.sh`, `linux.sh`, `macos.sh`, `watchOS`, and `tvos.sh` to build `FFmpeg` for each native platform.
All scripts support additional options to enable optional libraries and disable platform architectures.
